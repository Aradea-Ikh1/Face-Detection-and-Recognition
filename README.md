# Description Mask-Detection-Using-Tensorflow
This Face Detection and Recognition program uses a webcam to detect faces and identify the person in real time. It relies on OpenCV for the face detection process and the face_recognition library to achieve high-accuracy recognition and comparison against a stored face database. The user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter and CustomTkinter.
